## slam_if_1d.m

It performs an interactive simulation of SLAM with information filter,
which is a one-dimensional linear simulation of  Simultaneous Localization 
and Mapping (SLAM) with the information filter It is meant to serve as an 
introduction to the basic steps of IF SLAM and to explore some important 
traits of feature-based SLAM information filters. Feel free to play with
the parameter settings to see how they affect the information filter.

## slam_if_2d.m

It performs an interactive simulation of SLAM with information filter,
which is a two-dimensional linear simulation of Simultaneous Localization 
and Mapping (SLAM) with the information filter. It is meant to serve as an 
introduction to the basic steps of IF SLAM and to explore some important 
traits of feature-based SLAM information filters. Feel free to play with
the parameter settings to see how they affect the information filter.

** Note:**

This code is rewritten on the basis of Matthew R. Walter's code, which as 
part of a 2006 SLAM Summer School(Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
lab on the information filter.
